When happy, cats create a vibration in their chest known as 'purring' to express their contentment.
They possess a 'righting reflex,' a remarkable ability to twist their bodies in mid-air to land on their feet.
Cats can rotate their ears nearly 180 degrees to pinpoint even the smallest and most distant sounds.
Unlike many other animals, cats lack the taste buds for sweetness and cannot perceive the taste of sugar.
'Kneading' or 'making biscuits' is a leftover instinct from kittenhood used to stimulate milk flow from their mother.
Cats have very few sweat glands and primarily cool down through their paw pads or by panting.
