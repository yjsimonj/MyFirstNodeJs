Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning a protein-based diet is an absolute necessity for their survival.
They are crepuscular animals, inheriting wild instincts that make them most active during dawn and dusk.
On average, cats sleep between 12 to 16 hours a day to efficiently conserve their energy.
As territorial animals, they are highly sensitive to changes in their environment and value a sense of security.
They maintain cleanliness, regulate body temperature, and relieve stress through self-grooming.
While they have a strong independent streak, they can form deep bonds and show great affection toward their owners.
