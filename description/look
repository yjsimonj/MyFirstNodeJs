A cat's flexible spinal structure allows it to fit through tight spaces and leap gracefully to high places.
They have soft pads on their paws, often called 'beans,' which enable them to walk silently while hunting or moving.
Their eyes are highly sensitive to light, with pupils that change size to allow for excellent vision in the dark.
Whiskers are not just hair; they are vital sensory organs that detect air currents and distances around the face.
The tail acts as a counterweight for balance and serves as a primary tool for communicating their mood.
A cat's tongue is covered in tiny barbs called papillae, which are perfect for scraping meat off bones or combing fur.
